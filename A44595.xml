            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <argument>
               <p>An Abſtract of a Letter from <hi>Sutton</hi> near <hi>Wisbich,</hi> of a <hi>Whale</hi> taken there  74 foot long, whoſe Mouth opens 15 Foot, with ſome Quaeries about it. This Whale 14 Foot longer than that taken by Sir <hi>Anthony Dean,</hi> 1658.  A Whale judged to weigh 100 Tuns. A Temple whoſe Rafters and Beams were of Whale bone. A Whales Rib of ſuch an Arch, that a Man on a Camel did ride under it. A Whale taken in <hi>Kent</hi> 22 Yards long, with his Deſcription, and of others. Eight ſorts of Whales with their Deſcription. A Whale 30 Ells long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whales cry when they Engender, and bring forth their young alive.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>TWo Friends of mine did me the favour to ſhew me their Letters received laſt <hi>Monday</hi> from <hi>Sutton</hi> near <hi>Wisbich,</hi> in <hi>Lincoln</hi>-ſhire, from <hi>William Hide,</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> where he gives an account, That on <hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 14. 1692/3 was taken in his Lordſhip, called <hi>Sutton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Waſh,</hi> a Whale 74 foot long, whoſe Mouth open'd 15 Foot wide, capable to receive a Coach and Six Horſes. He ſent ſome Stuff taken out from the bottom of the great <hi>Whalebone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Finns</hi> in his Mouth, which I tryed, and it will yield no Oyl, and is not <hi>Sperma Caeti.</hi> He deſires to know where the <hi>Sperma Caeti</hi> lies, in what places the <hi>Whalebone</hi> grows, and whither any part be <hi>Whalebone,</hi> other than the <hi>Finn;</hi> and whether any thing can be made of him beſide the <hi>Blubber, Whalebone,</hi> and <hi>Sperma Caeti;</hi> and whether the <hi>Brains</hi> be not <hi>Sperma Caeti.</hi> An Anſwer to which I give as follows:</p>
            <p>This <hi>Whale</hi> is a very large one, according to the beſt of my remembrance, fourteen Foot longer than that taken by Sir <hi>Anthony Dean,</hi> in 1658 one of the Ribs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I believe is in the Court-yard at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; for I think Sir <hi>Anthony Dean</hi> told me that <hi>Whale</hi> was but Sixty Foot long. I find in <hi>Purchas's, Pilgrims, Vol.</hi> 1, <hi>pag.</hi> 420. mention of a <hi>Whale</hi> the Seamen judged to be <hi>One Hundred Tune</hi> in weight.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 772. he ſpeaks of a Temple whoſe <hi>Rafters</hi> and <hi>Beams</hi> were of <hi>Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone;</hi> and the Relator was ſhewn a <hi>Whales Rib</hi> of ſo great a ſize, that lying on the Ground, with the Convex or howing ſide upward, in manner of an Arch, it reſembled a Gate, the hollow or inward part whereof aloft they could not touch with their Heads, as they rode upon their Camels backs. This Rib the Native ſaid had lain there an hundred Years.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 737. there is a <hi>Whale</hi> deſcribed, taken in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> in <hi>Kent, July.</hi> the 9th. 1574. ſhooting himſelf on Shore, beſide <hi>Rammeſgate,</hi> about ſix at Night, and died about ſix next Morning, before which time he Roared, and was heard more than a mile on the Land. The length was Twenty Two yards; the neither Jaw <unclear>Seventy</unclear> Two Foot in the opening. One of his Eyes (which, in the <hi>Greenland VVhale</hi> is not much greater than that of an Oxe) was more than ſix Horſes in a Cart could draw. A Man ſtood upright in the place whence the Eye was taken. The thickneſs from his back whereon he lay, to his Belly was 14 Foot; his Tail
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61753:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 25 -->of the ſame breadth: Three Men ſtood upright in his Mouth: Betwixt his Eyes 12 Foot: Some of the Ribs 16 Foot long: The Tongue 15 Foot long: His Liver two Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads; Into his Noſtrils any Man might have crept: The Oyl of his Head, <hi>Sperma Caeti,</hi> &amp;e.</p>
            <p>In the ſame <hi>Vol. p.</hi> 470. is the Deſcription of ſeveral ſorts and mnaner of killing them; an Epitome whereof take as follows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Whale</hi> is a Fiſh about 65 Foot long, and 35 Foot thick, his Head a Third of his Body's Quantity, his Mouth containing a very great Tongue, and all his Finns.</p>
            <p>Theſe Finns are rooted in his upper Chap, and ſpread over his Tongue on both ſides his Mouth, being 250 on each ſide. The longeſt Finns are plac'd in the midſt of his Mouth, and the reſt ſhorten by degrees backward and forward, from ten or eleven Foot long to four Inches in length: His Eye as big as an Oxes, and the former great Eye men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Margin: His Body almoſt round forward, growing ſtill narrower towards his Tayl from his Body: His Tayl is above twenty Foot broad, of a tough ſolid Subſtance, as are his two ſwimming Finns, and they grow forward.</p>
            <p>He comes often above Water, ſpouting eight or nine times before his return; whereby he may be ſeen two or three Leagues off. Then they make to him, catch him, kill him, and order him for a Market, as may there be ſeen at large.</p>
            <p>There are deſcribed eight ſorts of Whales: The <hi>Grand Bay,</hi> which is <hi>black,</hi> with a <hi>ſmooth Skin,</hi> and <hi>white</hi> underneath the Chaps. The beſt for <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Finns</hi> (the older the better.] This ſort yields above 100 Hogſheads of Oyl, and 500 Finns.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Sarda,</hi> of the ſame colour, but leſs, yielding leſſer <hi>Finns,</hi> and about 70 or 80 Hogſheads of <hi>Oyl.</hi> This hath naturally growing on his Back white things like <hi>Barnacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Trumpa,</hi> as long as the firſt, but thicker forwards, of colour more <hi>Gray,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but one Spout in his Head, and the reſt have all two. He hath Teeth as thick as a Man's Wriſt, a Span long, but no <hi>Finns:</hi> His Head is bigger than the two former, and in proportion far bigger than his Body. In his Head is the <hi>Sperma caeti,</hi> which lyeth in a hole like a Well; he yields about forty Hogſheads of Oyl, beſide the <hi>Sperma caeti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Otta Sotta,</hi> of the ſame colour with the <hi>Trumpa,</hi> having <hi>white Finns</hi> in his Mouth, but not above half Yard long, thicker than the <hi>Trumpa,</hi> but ſhorter: He yields the beſt <hi>Oyl,</hi> but not above thirty Hogſheads.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Gibarta,</hi> black like the two firſt, having a <hi>Finn</hi> ſtanding on the top of his Back half Yard long: He is as big as the firſt: His <hi>Finns</hi> little or nothing worth, being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half a Yard long: He yields about twelve Hogſheads of Oyl from his Back, but his Belly yields none.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Sedena,</hi> being of a whitely colour, and bigger than any of the former: The <hi>Finns</hi> not above one Foot long, and yields little or no Oyl.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Sedena Negro,</hi> black, with a Bump on his Back, he yields neither <hi>Oyl, Finns,</hi> nor <hi>Teeth,</hi> and yet is of great bigneſs.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>Sewria,</hi> as white as Snow, of the bigneſs of a Wherry: yields but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Hogsheads of <hi>Oyl,</hi> nor any <hi>Finns,</hi> and is good Meat.</p>
            <p>In the ſaid Third <hi>Vol. p.</hi> 649. is mention of a <hi>Whale</hi> thirty Ells long, and his heighth more than a warlike Pike.</p>
            <p>In another place, 'tis ſaid the Whales cry in <hi>Engendring;</hi> and I am told they give <hi>ſuck,</hi> and are <hi>Viviparous</hi> (bringers forth alive.)</p>
            <p>The Whalebone, or Finn grows no where but in the Mouth, and I am told the uſe of it to the Whale is as a Weare, which he can lay cloſe and widen, that Fiſh may get in, but then letting them looſe, they lie together, and let no Fiſh go back, and ſo gets his living.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fleſh</hi> of him will be excellent <hi>Manure</hi> for Land, and his <hi>Ribs,</hi> other <hi>Bones, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Finns,</hi> and <hi>Tayl,</hi> will be Curioſities for after Ages; and if a Preſent were made to the Royal Society, I believe 'twould be very acceptable.</p>
            <p>The great Eye is not much ſtranger than the Fiſh; but I give the Account faithfully, believe as you pleaſe. I am told there are many more ſorts of Whales.</p>
            <p>If this finds a kind Acceptance, Accounts of other ſtrange things may hereafter be given by</p>
